***Graduate stage (Principle investigator: Tao Zhang, Ph.D.) at Tianjin University, Tianjin, China***
**Efficient convolution neural network (CNN) for mobile applications**
◆	Research on the reduction of computational complexity and resource cost without much performance degradation.
◆	Investigation on how to reduce the feature redundancy in CNN architecture.
◆	Extracted feature representions to solve multimedia tasks, including acoustic scene classification, sound event detection and image classification.
**Detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events**
◆	To recognize an audio scene or a sound event either from a recording or an on-line stream through pattern recognition and signal processing.
◆	Illustrated the relationship between receptive field in CNN and time-frequency feature resolution in mel energy spectrogram.
◆	Proposed a deep CNN architecture using the fine resolution feature. 
**Image recognition with system on chip (SoC)**
◆	To classify the fruit categories in the captured image with TI AM5708.
◆	Responsible for the setup of deep learning environment, models comparison and selection, model compression and optimization.
◆	Successfully classified 98 categories of fruits in a short duration.


***Undergraduate stage at Tianjin University, Tianjin, China***
**Image denoising based on residual learning and batch normalization** 
◆   To recover images from Gaussian noise with unknown noise level.
◆	Mainly responsible for implementing various denoising methods for comparison.
◆	Experimentally verified the effect of residual learning strategy and batch normalization for CNN denoising.
**Research and development on 2-D sonar equipment based on beamforming**
◆	To measure the distance and the depth of streambed ahead in real-time.
◆	Developed a suitable beamforming algorithm under the limitation of fixed arrays.
◆	Designed an underwater 2-D detection system using the vernier method.
